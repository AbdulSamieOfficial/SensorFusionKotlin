# Proximity Sensor Distance and Height Measurement

This Android application allows you to measure distance and height using the proximity sensor and sensor fusion techniques.

## Features

- Measures the distance and height using the proximity sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors.
- Utilizes sensor fusion techniques, including a complementary filter, to improve measurement accuracy.
- Displays the real-time distance and height measurements on the screen.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (version 4.0 or above)
- Android device or emulator with a proximity sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Connect your Android device to the computer or launch an emulator.
4. Build and run the application on the device/emulator.

## Usage

1. Launch the application on your Android device/emulator.
2. Place the device in a stationary position, preferably on a flat surface.
3. The application will display the real-time distance and height measurements on the screen.
4. Move the device and observe how the distance and height values change accordingly.
5. Note that accurate measurements may require sensor calibration and stable sensor readings.
